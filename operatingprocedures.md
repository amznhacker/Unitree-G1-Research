ill be operated indoors our outdoors. WHen operating, once the battery hit's 25 percent for safety we must return to the car or home base. Unitree g1 runs for up to two hours. 
Take pictures before leaving the home and after. The g1 has clothes on as well. (We need to figure out what parts must be documented) 
Wjhat about where he sits 

The robot fits best with size 5.5 shoes, however it is hard to put on, we are using boots that are siez 6.5, they are much easier to put on. It takes some practice, however he tries to balance himself, as the shoes are not a perfect fit, perhaps we can add some filling to it. 
# Clothing 
Tshirt with branding - The black tshirt was big and it fell multiple times, therefore some of the shirt ripped. 
The shoes were nike brand 5.5 U.S they work well and fit well, however part of it started ripping. 


If anything breaks replace the part or find a professional welder, do not JB weld. 

Add tracking devices to equipment like controller and robots.
