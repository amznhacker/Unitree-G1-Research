## Pre-Operation Checklist

### Robot Condition Assessment
- [ ] Battery level check (must be >50% before departure)
- [ ] Joint movement test (all joints operational)
- [ ] Sensor functionality check
- [ ] Controller connectivity test
- [ ] Emergency stop function test

### Accessories and Equipment
- [ ] Footwear: Size 6.5 boots (easier application than 5.5 shoes)
- [ ] Clothing: Branded t-shirt (properly fitted to prevent tearing)
- [ ] Controller with tracking device attached
- [ ] Spare batteries/charging equipment
- [ ] First aid kit
- [ ] Documentation materials (camera, logbook)
- [ ] Weather monitoring equipment

### Environmental Assessment
- [ ] Weather conditions suitable (temperature, precipitation, wind)
- [ ] Location scouting completed
- [ ] Indoor/outdoor operation determined
- [ ] Route planning completed
- [ ] Emergency contact information available

## Safety Protocols

### Battery Management
- **CRITICAL**: Return to base when battery reaches 25%
- Maximum operation time: 2 hours
- Monitor battery levels every 30 minutes
- Always carry backup power source

### Environmental Considerations
- Check temperature range compatibility
- Avoid operation in extreme weather conditions
- Ensure adequate lighting for outdoor operations
- Maintain safe distance from traffic and crowds

### Personnel Safety
- Minimum 2-person operation team required
- Maintain visual contact with robot at all times
- Keep emergency stop controller accessible
- Establish communication protocols

## Equipment and Accessories

### Footwear Guidelines
- **Primary**: Size 6.5 boots (recommended for ease of application)
- **Alternative**: Size 5.5 Nike shoes (better fit but difficult to apply)
- **Issue**: Size 6.5 boots may affect balance - consider adding padding/filling
- **Maintenance**: Inspect for wear/tearing before each use

### Clothing Requirements
- Branded t-shirt (ensure proper fit to prevent tearing)
- **Lesson Learned**: Oversized clothing causes operational issues
- Replace damaged clothing immediately
- Document clothing condition in pre/post operation photos

### Tracking Equipment
- Attach GPS tracking devices to:
  - Robot chassis
  - Controller
  - Any detachable accessories

## Operation Guidelines

### Pre-Departure Protocol
1. Complete pre-operation checklist
2. Take comprehensive photos of robot condition
3. Log planned route and destinations
4. Verify weather conditions
5. Confirm emergency contacts
6. Test all communication equipment

### During Operation
1. Monitor battery levels continuously
2. Document all activities and observations
3. Take photos at key locations/milestones
4. Log any issues or anomalies immediately
5. Maintain operation log with timestamps

### Post-Operation Protocol
1. Take comprehensive photos of robot condition
2. Complete operation log
3. Assess any damage or wear
4. Clean and store equipment properly
5. Charge batteries immediately
6. File operation report

2. Navigate to nearest safe location
3. Contact base/transport
4. Document circumstances
5. Prepare for emergency shutdown if necessary

### Equipment Failure
1. Activate emergency stop
2. Secure robot in safe position
3. Document failure mode
4. Contact technical support
5. Do not attempt field repairs

### Weather Emergency
1. Seek immediate shelter
2. Protect robot from elements
3. Monitor for system alerts
